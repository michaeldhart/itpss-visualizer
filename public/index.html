        <p>
            The Illinois Department of Transportation has released its 2019 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.idot.illinois.gov/transportation-system/local-transportation-partners/law-enforcement/illinois-traffic-stop-study">Illinois Traffic and Pedestrian Stop Study</a>. This study provides valuable information about local police departments and may help to determine whether or not each department exhibits any racial bias in their traffic stop practices.

            In my conversations with people, it seemed that there was a lot of confusion on what exactly the data is telling us. We're not all data scientists and complex data sets can be hard to interpret. I realized that visualizing some of the data might make its findings more clear. That is the purpose of this site.
