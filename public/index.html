        <p>
            The Illinois Department of Transportation has released its 2019 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.idot.illinois.gov/transportation-system/local-transportation-partners/law-enforcement/illinois-traffic-stop-study">Illinois Traffic and Pedestrian Stop Study</a>. This study provides valuable information about local police departments and may help to determine whether or not each department exhibits any racial bias in their traffic stop practices.

            In my conversations, it seemed that there was a lot of confusion on what exactly the data is telling us. We're not all data scientists and complex data sets can be hard to interpret. Sometimes making data more visual helps us to understand what's going on in the numbers. That is the purpose of this site.

        <h3>General Population</h3>
        <div class="row">
            In this study, IDOT counted <span id="total-benchmark"></span> people in this municipality. The racial makeup of these people is reflected by the following table:
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <table class="u-full-width pop-legend">

                Note: other categories of reported races have been omitted because the data reported for those categories was statistically insignificant.

            If this municipality were represented by <span class="sample-size"></span> dots, it would look like the following:

        <h3>Assuming No Bias</h3>
        <p>
            <span id="total-stops"></span> stops were reported by this municipality in 2019. In our scaled-down municipality of <span class="sample-size"></span> people, we would have <span id="sample-stops"></span> stops. If those stops reflected the racial makeup of the larger municipality, they would look like this:
        </p>
        <p class="stop-rate-disclaimer small"></p>
        <div class="row">
            <div>Figure 2.</div>
            <div id="no-bias-chart"></div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h3>Actual Results</h3>
        <p>
            The actual racial representation of traffic stops for this municipality according to this report looked like this:
        </p>
        <p class="stop-rate-disclaimer"></p>
        <div class="row">
            <div>Figure 3.</div>
            <div id="bias-chart"></div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h3>Projected Population</h3>
        <p>
            Here is what our <span class="sample-size"></span> dots would look like if they matched the racial makeup of the actual traffic stop results for this municipality:
        </p>
        <div class="row">
            <div>Figure 4.</div>
            <div id="projected-pop-chart"></div>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            The degree to which racial bias exists in this municipality, according to the data of this study, is reflected in the above charts. How similar are Figure 2 and Figure 3? Figure 1 and Figure 4? The more similar they are, the less racial bias is presented by the data. The more different they are, the more racial bias is presented by the data.

            This study contains much more data than presented in these graphs. I chose to select the simplest set of data which I believe is the easiest to understand and which does the best job of summarizing the outcomes of the study - namely the "Rate Ratio vs White". Please feel free to visit the study at the link above for more detailed information.
